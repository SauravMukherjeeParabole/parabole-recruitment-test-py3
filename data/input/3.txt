Ryanair are getting greedier. We checked in online a few days prior to our flight to save time at the airport. When choosing our seats, the website provided us seats at each end of the plane. If we wanted to be seated together, it charged us £9.00. We did opt for that, however when we got on the plane there were many unoccupied seats throughout the plane, including the third seat next to us on the aisle. Therefore, there was absolutely no need to have charged us to seat next to each other. Daylight robbery.The seats also had food debris over the seats and floor. No attempt to clean it before we got on. Again, Ryanair are more interested in money than customer service.If you don't pay for priority boarding, you get your small suitcase taken off you and put in the hold albeit for free.We had a 2 hour delay - which was actually appreciated on that occasion as it gave us the opportunity to watch the royal wedding in the departure lounge.
