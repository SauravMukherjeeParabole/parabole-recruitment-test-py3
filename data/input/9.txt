After flying on budget airlines it was a pleasure to fly SDA this time. We were flying with our daughter who has a peanut allergy. We were taken seriously and an an announcement was made over the tannoy. The short flight to Amsterdam was very efficient - the flight actually arrived 25 minutes early. We even reviewed a sandwich, biscuit, water and a drink (Heineken was a nice treat). Would definitely recommend to other flyers.
