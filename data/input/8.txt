This was the first time that we have flown business class and we were hoping to be impressed - and we were! Maybe other airlines are as good - we will see, as we are now spoiled and only want to travel this way! The business class lounge with lots of complimentary food and drink was very relaxing whilst waiting for boarding and the priority boarding was a bonus too. On board KLM gave a good and attentive service with pleasant meals, endless drinks (I only had champagne!) and comfortable fold back chair/bed. There was somewhere to plug in your lap top and ample storage which helped make the 15 hour journey so much more enjoyable. Too many gifts in my opinion - china houses (which lots of other travellers seem to collect) and a rather cheap looking purse/clutch with toothpaste, ear plugs etc. in. Personally I would forfeit this sort of thing for a cheaper fare. Nevertheless travelling business class is so worth it and a great way to end a holiday.
