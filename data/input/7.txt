Where do I start?I vowed several years ago I would not use SD again, I needed to get home in a direct route so chose not to go via Heathrow and fly direct to Manchester, big mistake.Flying business class should be a good experience, not if the product and quality of service are not up to the job, tired seating, no proper in flight entertainment system (who wants to watch a movie on a IPad four feet away, madness) no route plan or flight information, grumpy staff who chose to chatter most of the flight home leaving anyone near the crew in the front few rows with the impossible task of sleeping.The food and beverage service was terrible, old tired staff, like being served G&T's by your aged mother, horrible and with a grumpy attitude, not pretty.Never again.
