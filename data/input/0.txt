Got booked on Air Canada flights to get to & from Toronto within Canada on Star Alliance network. To be fair, the rest of our trip was on Air New Zealand, so the Canadians had a hard act to follow!We found the Air Canada experience fairly "average". Nothing stood out as particularly great or terrible. Food had to be purchased using a credit card but luckily we had our own as the trolleys seemed to take quite some time to arrive. After food purchasing there were 2 welcome complimentary services of soft drinks on the flight of some 5 hours.Great to have complimentary seat-back entertainment on a long domestic flight even though the film choices were fairly limited.It would have been ideal to have pillows and blankets available in the cabin for greater comfort for a lengthy flight .The cabin crew could best be described as 'disinterested' when asked a question about in-flight service available.However, the aircraft was clean, on time, modern, and safe so on balance I'd be prepared to fly Air Canada economy in the future.
