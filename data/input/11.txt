KUL-HKG-KUL on SD72 and SD73. Both legs flown by SD's 20 year workhorse 772s. Didn't think too much of the supposed loud engine noise seen in some of the comments here. Prefer these older 772 seats with SD rather than the new ones installed in their 388s and 738s as they have more legroom pitch and comfort. Plane interior (seat pockets galleys toilets etc.) were quite clean well maintained and in good working order. FAs were quite friendly and helpful on both legs. Drinks served every hour with meal and snacks served throughout the 3+ hour flight. Only slight comment would be about the IFEs on the 772s. Smaller and dated screen compared to the newer SD planes but functions just as well as the new systems.
