Auckland to Kuala Lumpur. I had a comfortable flight and I would like to especially thank the crew. Thank you. Food was good. The business class seats were a bit narrow and the sleep bed was not that comfortable, but overall it was okay.SYD-LHR-SYD in Business Class. SYD-KUL-SYD on SD330-300 and KUL-LHR-KUL on SD380. All flights on time. Aircraft on all four flights were new and clean. Cabin crew were excellent on all flights. They were polite helpful friendly and always addressed me by name. Booked meals via Chef-on-call all of which were honoured. Meals were tasty and of a decent portion. IFE was AVOD and had a reasonably good selection of latest releases as well as older favourites. Seats on the SD330-300 were comfortable in the sitting and reclining positions but are angled flat and not that comfortable for sleeping. Storage space is severely lacking in these seats. Seats on the SD380 are far superior. They are very comfortable in all positions and are completely flat which allowed me to get a good amount of sleep. There is also an excellent amount of storage space especially for window seats. SDA now provide covers for their business class seats that help to smooth out the seat and add a little more padding. Bathrooms were always kept clean on all flights. Priority for premium classes and elite level passengers was provided when available for things such as check-in security and immigration boarding disembarking baggage delivery and customs. Overall an excellent product that is let down a little by the seats on their SD330-300 which really need to be completely flat. My only other suggestion for SDA would be to serve champagne as a pre-departure beverage as it is currently their policy not to. Otherwise it was an excellent flight experience from beginning to end and it was also competitively priced which made it excellent value for money. I would not hesitate to fly with them.
