Flew short haul business from Tianjin to Seoul. I was disappointed that there is no permanently open Singdisher counter at the airport. for being a little bit too early i had to wait for the counter to open. For a short haul the business class is very comfortable with 2-2 configuration.  I was the sole passenger in the business class so i had all the attention of the responsible flight attender. Food was okay. I had a very nice short flight.
