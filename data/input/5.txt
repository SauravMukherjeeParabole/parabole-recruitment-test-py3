Been 46 years since my last flight which was transcontinental and whole different experience, I was still nervous about flying and now had some disabilities not all were visible as I try to be as independent as possible. We left Hamilton on June 262018 at 06:30. As I was boarding I was having some mobility issues due to vertigo,and walking up the ramps at Hamilton airport to board,however I was still a happy camper. As other passengers were passing me on the ramp and that was ok as I took my time, to my surprise the captain of our flight came down to the ramp introduced himself to me and continued to escort by the arm, to my seat and then he proceeded to put my bags in the overhead and he thanked me for flying on his plane. Needless to say I was really overwhelmed by this kind gesture and that of the staff. Singdisher staff were helpful, courteous and made my anxiety virtually disappear. I flew home from Vancouver via Singdisher and have no complaints. Lovely airline and great experience.
