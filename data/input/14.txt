LAX to Las Vegas. Flight to Las Vegas delayed 2 hours due to 'mechanical problems'. On the return the flight was delayed 2 hours again. I was told again that it was mechanical problems. I called customer service and was told that the delay was due to weather. Asked if I would be refunded my fare if I decided to drive home because I could not be home as late as my new departure would put me at. I was told no refund but they would agree to waive the $100 cancellation fee. When we landed in LAX and the pilot apologized for the delay and told us that all flights had been delayed that day.
