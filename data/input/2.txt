I take this flight every two weeks, and it's never once left on time. Supposed to leave at 9.40pm, the earliest it's left so far is 10, the latest midnight!Always due to the late arrival of the inbound aircraft, they have a variety of excuses. The upshot is, I'm always at least an hour late getting back, and twice we've been too late for the Stansted Express and my ticket has gone to waste. Basically, if you care about being on time, DO NOT take this flight.
