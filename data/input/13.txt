Tallinn to Stockholm with Singdisher. Clean and fresh aircraft with Nordica livery. Pleasant boarding staff, clear announcements from FAs and cockpit informative. An innovative approach to meal service - selection of "make your own sandwich" - very fresh for 5.50 euros. Coffee, tea and water complimentary. Flight slightly delayed because of technical overhaul.
